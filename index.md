# TechEvents Project Report

Everyday, students at Georgia Tech receive countless emails which can become difficult to manage through simple email inboxes. Many of the emails students receive contain information pertaining to events around campus. However due to the difficulty of managing emails through inboxes, this information is often forgotten, lost, or never even seen by students. A common method across Georgia Tech to create, store, manage, and view events is desperately needed to allieviate the email spam towards students and increase events awareness.

## Software Development Stages

The following sections breakdown the four major stages of our project, planning, requirements, design, and test. Each stage's section overviews our team's thought processes and actions taken.

### Planning Stage

At the beginning of this project we struggled to come up with an idea for something we could implement that would be both interesting and difficult enough for the assignment. We initialy wanted to created either an iOS exclusive app or some form of video game through Unity. These ideas came from prior experiences some group members had with projects but ultimately we did not have enough commitment into either of these ideas and we did not pursue them. Our final idea we came up with and eventually agreed to work on was the Georgia Tech campus event manager. Each of us agreed that a common frustration we all experienced was in regards to the email spam Tech students recieve and determined that a large majority of these could be eliminated through an email external event management system. From there we agreed on various features we wanted the app to implement, a rough timeline of when items would need to be completed, our target platform, and our methodological approach to this project. We chose the Waterfall methodology for this project as we felt this best suited both our timescale and the smaller project size for this idea.

### Requirements Stage

For our group this stage was fairly short and straightforward, however the importance of this stage cannot be undervalued. During this stage we ensured that our idea and plan that we had created in the previous stage, met all of the requirements laid out to us for the assigment. We felt that the newness to the group of the technologies that we agreed to use, added to the difficulty of our idea in regards to the assignment description. Additionally, we felt that the relevancy of solving an issue many students at Tech experience matched well with the assignment description. Overall we felt that after a short analysis of our idea and plan, we could proceed to the design stage of the project as we covered all needed aspects of the assignment.

### Design Stage

During this stage of the assignment we began our implementation of our idea and the plan we had created in previous stages. We had agreed to use the waterfall methodology as such, we held 1-2 weekly meetings where we would divide up work to be completed before our next meeting. This allowed us to continually build the app while maintaing our rough schedule we had created in the planning stage and also allowed us to maintain the waterfall approach of completing work before moving onto new items. Alongside this process we also determined that it would be better to divide the frontend and backend work from one another and connect them in the end. This allowed us to maintain our schedule with the time constraints we were experiencing and develop the two sides of the application concurrently. Overall, this ended up working well for our group and allowed us to stay on schedule and coplete work that was independent of other areas. The only issue this caused was some difficulties in connecting the frontend and backend back together and this would be an aspect to consider in future assignments.

### Test Stage

This final stage of development was done concurrently with the Design stage so that we were able to test alongside development of new features to ensure that new additions work entirely as intended. Throughout the development of the application, various testing technologies were used for both the frontend and backend. For the frontend, Expo and ExpoGO were predominantly used to test the user interface. These tools wer chosen as they allowed us to test the application during development on our own iOS and Android devices. As for the backend, Postman and Jest were the primary technologies used for testing. Postman allowed us to test our API endpoints and to ensure that our calls to our database worked as intended. Jest allowed us to test our JavaScript code to further ensure the functionalities we were creating worked as intended. The concurrent style of testing worked well for our group and this project, allowing us to continually test new features as they were added and would be a consideration to use again in future projects.
