#TechEvents Project Report
Everyday, students at Georgia Tech receive countless emails which can become difficult to manage through simple email inboxes. Many of the emails students receive contain information pertaining to events around campus. However due to the difficulty of managing emails through inboxes, this information is often forgotten, lost, or never even seen by students. A common method across Georgia Tech to create, store, manage, and view events is desperately needed to allieviate the email spam towards students and increase events awareness.
